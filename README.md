# Project Setup and Usage Guide

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher recommended)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Ensure Typescript is Working

To ensure TypeScript is set up correctly, run:

```sh
npm run start
```

### 3. Build The Project

To compile all TypeScript files and generate the `dist` directory, run:

This will use the TypeScript compiler to transpile your TypeScript files into JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

To run a specific file from the `dist` directory, use the `node` command followed by the path to the file. For example, to run `soal-1.ts`, use:

```sh
node dist/soal-1.js
```
